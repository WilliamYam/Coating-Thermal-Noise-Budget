function [sys, flexTfs] = linFlexTf(varargin)
% LINFLEXTF  Linearizes a Simulink model while removing FlexTf blocks
%
%   [sys, flexTfs] = linFlexTf(...)
%
%   LINFLEXTF is a wrapper for Matlab's LINLFT, and can be called in almost
%   the same way.  The only difference is that it's not necessary to
%   specify the set of blocks to be removed, since this is automatically
%   determined by LINFLEXTF.  The blocks removed are those that are
%   annotated with a "FlexTf: EXPR" line at the top of their block
%   description.
%
%   For each FlexTf-tagged block, LINFLEXTF evaluates the EXPR.  The result
%   is expected to be a linear model (such as an FRD object containing
%   frequency response data), which can be substituted in place of the
%   block in question.
%
%   Note: although the contents of a FlexTf-tagged subsystem are
%   overridden, it is necessary that all inputs are connected inside the
%   subsystem to the outputs that they affect.  Otherwise the linearization
%   may give incorrect results.
%
%   LINFLEXTFFOLD (analogous to LINLFTFOLD) can be used to recombine the
%   Simulink linearization and FlexTf models that are the output arguments
%   of LINFLEXTF.  It may be advantageous to call PRESCALE to improve the
%   numerical accuracy before invoking LINFLEXTFFOLD.
%
%   See also: LINFLEXTFFOLD, LINLFT, LINLFTFOLD, PRESCALE, FRD.
